<p>Pythagoras and other philosophers of hte time believed that because mathematical concepts were more "practical" (easier to regulate and classify) than physical ones, they ahd greater actuality. St. Augustine of Hipp (A.D. 354-430) wrote "Numbers are the Unviersal language offered by the deity to humans as confirmation of the truth." Similar to Pythagoras, he too believed that everything had numerical relationships and it was up to the mind to seek and investigate the secreats of these relationships or have them revealed by divine grace. -Wikipedia</p>
